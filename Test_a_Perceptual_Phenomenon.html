Question 1: Identify variables in the experiment

Q1: Question response correctly identifies the independent and dependent variables in the experiment.

The independent variable is whether the list is of congruent or incongruent words.
The dependent variable is the time it takes to name the ink colours in equally-sized lists.

Question 2a: Establish hypotheses

Q2a: Null and alternative hypotheses are clearly stated in words and mathematically. Symbols in the mathematical statement are defined.

My Null Hypotheses is that the mean time to name the ink colours for both congruent and incongruent words are the same My Alternative Hypotheses is that the mean time to name the ink colours is NOT the same
H_0 u1-u2 = 0
H_1 u1-u2 != 0
u1 is Congruent
u2 is Incongruent

Question 2b: Establish a statistical test

Q2b: A statistical test is proposed which will distinguish the proposed hypotheses. Any assumptions made by the statistical test are addressed.

My Null Hypotheses is true before testing, and states two groups are equal My Alternative Hypotheses is what we would like to prove to be true

Question 3: Report descriptive statistics

Q3: Descriptive statistics, including at least one measure of centrality and one measure of variability, have been computed for the dataset’s groups.

	Congruent	Incongruent
count	24.000000	24.000000
mean	14.051125	22.015917
std	3.559358	4.797057
min	8.630000	15.687000
25%	11.895250	18.716750
50%	14.356500	21.017500
75%	16.200750	24.051500
max	22.328000	35.255000

For the Congruent sample: The mean time was 14.051125 seconds The standard deviation was 3.559358 seconds
Tor the Incongruent sample The mean time was 22.015917 seconds The standard deviation was 4.797057 seconds


Question 4: Plot the data

Q4: One or two visualizations have been created that show off the data, including comments on what can be observed in the plot or plots.

Question 5: Perform the statistical test and interpret your results

Q5: A statistical test has been correctly performed and reported, including test statistic, p-value, and test result. The test results are interpreted in terms of the experimental task performed. Alternatively, students may use a bootstrapping approach to simulate the results of a traditional hypothesis test.


We reject the null hypotheses because the p-value is 0.
The confidence level is 95% / Type I error rate of 0.05 because this test is associated with this two-sided test.
Yes, The results match up with your expectations, and personal experience with the Stroop test.

Question 6: Digging deeper and extending the investigation Question 6 is optional and does not need to be answered in order to meet project specifications.

Q6: Hypotheses regarding the reasons for the effect observed are presented. An extension or related experiment to the performed Stroop task is provided, that may produce similar effects.

Congruent words could be sensed by colour or reading. However Incongruent words require the brain to reconsile the difference, which may require additional time to answer.
Another task perhaps could be counting the number of words where the words are different numbers.
"...reading is much more practiced than color naming and therefore reading dominates naming without regard for attention, causing interference." A Protopapas
